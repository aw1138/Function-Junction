# Function-Junction
A repository to dump functions that I make while working.

All functions are written for Python 3 unless otherwise specified.

diffmag: A set of functions (getindex, matchLists, find_diff_mag) that can be used to find variability in magnitude of stars in a data set. The first two functions match between two sets of data based on ra and dec while the last finds the variability.

reduction_python: This function (reduce_data) will take the paths to your data and calibrations and do basic dark, bias, and flat removal using Python.
